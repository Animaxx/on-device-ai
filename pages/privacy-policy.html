            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                On-Device AI is provided by Zijie as a commercial application. This SERVICE is provided by Zijie and is intended for use as is.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page informs visitors of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information should anyone decide to use my Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using my Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information I collect is used solely for providing and improving the Service. Your information will not be used or shared with anyone except as explicitly described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible through On-Device AI, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
                To better support your privacy while using our Service, <strong>all data remains on your device</strong>. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data, voice recordings, transcriptions, or AI interactions on our servers or any third-party servers. All processing happens locally on your device.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>AI Models</h2>
            <p>
                The On-Device AI app uses machine learning models that run entirely on your device. These models may be downloaded to your device during installation or on-demand. The processing of your requests, including voice recognition and AI responses, happens locally without sending your data to external servers.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>App Permissions</h2>
            <p>
                To provide its functionality, On-Device AI may request permissions such as microphone access (for voice input) and storage access (to save your data locally). You can manage these permissions through your device settings. We only use these permissions to provide the app's core features.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                Since all data processing occurs locally on your device and no personal information is transmitted, the security of your data relies on the security measures of your own device and operating system. We encourage you to use strong device passcodes and keep your operating system updated. While we design the app with privacy as a core principle, remember that the physical security and software integrity of your device are crucial.
            </p>

            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>
                This Service may contain links to external websites (e.g., for web search functionality or within AI responses). If you click on a third-party link, you will be redirected to that website. Please note that these external websites are not operated by me. I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policies of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of third-party websites or services.
