            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                On-Device AI is provided by Zijie as a commercial application. This SERVICE is provided by Zijie and is intended for use as is.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page informs visitors of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information should anyone decide to use my Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using my Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information I collect is used solely for providing and improving the Service. Your information will not be used or shared with anyone except as explicitly described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible through On-Device AI, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
                Our app's core functionality is designed to be 100% on-device, meaning your data is processed and stored locally. However, we now offer an optional feature to connect with third-party cloud-based AI model providers. The use of this feature is off by default and requires your explicit consent and action to enable.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cloud Provider Integration (Optional)</h2>
            <p>
                This app allows you to optionally connect to third-party AI model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, OpenRouter, LM Studio, or Ollama) using your own API keys. This feature is <strong>off by default</strong> and must be actively enabled by you.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you choose to use a cloud-based model, the following information will be transmitted from your device directly to the selected third-party provider:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Prompts and Conversation History:</strong> The text you submit and the context of the current conversation are sent to the provider to generate a response.</li>
                <li><strong>Your API Key:</strong> This is sent to authenticate your request with the provider.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>We do not collect, view, or store this information on our servers.</strong> The transmission occurs directly between your device and the third-party provider's servers.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                When you use the cloud integration feature, you are subject to the privacy policies and terms of service of the respective providers. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. We strongly advise you to review their policies

        <section>
            <h2>User Consent</h2>
            <p>By entering your API key and instructing the app to interact with large language model services, you provide your explicit consent for us to process data strictly for the purpose of completing the task at hand.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>While the app itself does not store personal information, we securely store API keys, user conversations, and settings locally on your device using advanced security APIs designed to safeguard your data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>AI Models</h2>
            <p>
                The On-Device AI app uses machine learning models that run entirely on your device. These models may be downloaded to your device during installation or on-demand. The processing of your requests, including voice recognition and AI responses, happens locally without sending your data to external servers.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>App Permissions</h2>
            <p>
                To provide its functionality, On-Device AI may request permissions such as microphone access (for voice input) and storage access (to save your data locally). You can manage these permissions through your device settings. We only use these permissions to provide the app's core features.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                While data processed on-device is secured by your device's own security measures, any data transmitted to cloud providers is sent over an encrypted connection (HTTPS/TLS). However, once your data reaches the third-party provider, its security and privacy are governed by their policies and infrastructure. We encourage you to use strong device passcodes and keep your operating system updated.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
            <p>The app does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from children under the age of 13.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>
                This Service may contain links to external websites (e.g., for web search functionality or within AI responses). If you click on a third-party link, you will be redirected to that website. Please note that these external websites are not operated by me. I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policies of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of third-party websites or services.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to periodically review this page for any changes. Changes will be effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
